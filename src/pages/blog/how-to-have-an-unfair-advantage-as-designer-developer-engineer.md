Honestly, I would be quite impressed if a candidate could break down and articulate the problem we are trying to solve even before we could confirm them.

That means they have an ability that would be an asset to the business and the team.

When I have walked into interviews or meetings, I have always tried to:

> *Understand the value the company is trying to offer, to who and how it can make/save money/resources.*

But first you need to have some basic understanding of what business is:

Business is essentially:

* People
* Value - Product/Service (Tech)
* Profit

If you understand the value, the company offers then its super easy for you to:

1. Understanding your space/tools
2. Leveraging your strengths
3. Experiment/Innovate

**Understanding your space/tools**

When I started out in tech, I often got ignored because I used to ask the wrong questions. This often kept leading to the same response.

> *Google is your friend.*

It was frustrating up until I figured out how to solve my own problem by asking quality questions and learning how to learn.

From then on, I have been able to navigate the tech space quite easier and understood my tools in the process.

**Leveraging your strengths**

I figured where my strengths lie and capitalized on learning the various aspects of the disciplines, I was in.

I am a visual learner and with that I get to have the advantage to visualize complex solutions into simple diagrams, workflows, and lifecycles.

**Experiment/Innovating**

Before I understood what space and what my strengths were, I struggled with documentation and trying to understand languages.

Through a lot of grit, experiments, and little bit of direction, I have been able to find my lane that I have been running on and continue running.

> We must keep remembering that Software development is a marathon, and you often must run your own race and own pace.

I can guarantee you that if you can understand

1. The core fundamentals of business.
2. The space you occupy
3. Leverage on your strengths
4. Don't stop experimenting

You already have an advantage over the rest.
